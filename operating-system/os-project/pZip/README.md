#pZip project : Parallel Zip

In the wzip fold, I implemented a simple compression tool based on
run-length encoding, known simply as `wzip`. Here, I am gona implement something
similar, but use threads to make a parallel version of `wzip`. We'll
call this version ... wait for it ... `pzip`. 

There are three target when accomplish this prject:

* Familiarize with the Linux pthreads.
* Learn how to parallelize a program.
* Learn how to program for high performance.
